              I've been building websites since the 1990s. It started in
              college, with a short class at the library on using the World Wide
              Web and HTTP. From there, I moved on to designing sites with
              Dreamweaver, to getting curious about hand-coding in the 2000s,
              and teaching myself HTML, CSS, Actionscript in Flash, and then
              Javascript.
            </p>

            <p>
              Recently I completed the Meta Front-End Developer Certification,
              learning React and more of the latest web frameworks and libraries
              like Bootstrap and Tailwind. Being a web developer means
              constantly learning and evolving along with the one constant in
              life: change.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, I love to keep things simple and efficient, and I
              generally will write my own CSS like I did for this site.
            </p>

              your own work? I'm available for freelancing. Contact me at

              I fell in love with photography in junior college. This was in the
              days of manual cameras and film, darkrooms and developer. Ahh, the
              smell of the stop bath! I still remember the magic of seeing my
              first images appear in the dim red light.
            </p>
            <p>
              I went on to university and majored in photography, earning a
              bachelor's degree. I then worked in a professional photo lab,
              where I learned the arcane art of retouching negatives and prints.
              Meanwhile, I was building my own darkroom in the garage of my
              apartment.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I got a job as a photo editor at an educational institution
              that wrote and produced its own course materials, I gained
              valuable experience.From shooting corporate portraits and school
              events, to traveling to Asia and Australia to photograph pearl
              farms, it was an experience unlike any other.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lately I haven't done as much photography. I chalk it up to the
              advent of iPhone photography. I miss the days of looking through
              the viewfinder instead of squinting at a screen. My presbyopia
              probably contributes to this ðŸ˜†. I still have my equipment, and
              hope to rekindle my passion for it at some point.
            </p>
            <p>I'll be putting up some galleries of my old work soon.</p>

              I majored in art, and it has come in handy. I've made flyers,
              posters, and book covers, including covers for my own books.

              Technomania Circus, to be exact. A San Diego original. You can

              Being fairly shy, I started out by writing and creating my own

              fright and joining in everything else too.

              I wish I'd known how much I love engineering things when I was
              younger. I might've majored in that in college.
            </p>
            <p>
              I love building and making things with my hands. I'm also good at
              fixing things and figuring out how they work. So, when I got
              involved with Burning Man, I wanted to make things. Big things!
            </p>
            <p>
              My second year at Burning Man, I participated in a community art
              project. It had Center Camp placement. A giant eyeball that people
              could sit inside and communicate with another node on video, that
              was across the street at our camp, Furgloo. This was 2005.
            </p>
            <p>
              I always wanted to learn welding. I did, and ended up using that
              to make a welded burning angel that we took to the playa in 2006.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, I helped make a bottle wall installation called North County
              Jesus. A stained glass Jesus missing a face, so you could stick
              your face in the hole. The name was partly a tribute to Charlie
              (chasterus) at East Jesus. Who, by the way, told me to learn
              Python back around 2009. I should've listened to him. I still
              haven't learned Python, but plan to! RIP Charlie.

              I'm Valerie. I've been passionate about the arts my whole life. I
              wrote a travelog when I was 5, sketched horses and race cars in
              elementary school, learned drawing and painting in high school,
              and fell in love with photography in community college. This was
              in the old days of manual cameras and film, darkrooms and
              developer. I loved the the technology of it all as much as the
              art.
            </p>
            <p>
              At university, I began using the web in its infancy, and using
              digital imaging programs like Photoshop. I started designing and
              building websites in the late 90s.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout, I worked at public libraries, a photo lab, and an
              educational and research institution, gaining valuable experience.
              I got sent halfway around the world to take pictures. I learned
              how to write scripting languages, which led me to learn coding in
              more depth. Along the way, I explored Burning Man, began
              performing with a backyard circus, and eventually ran a live
              theater. I recently wrote three suspense novels and we are
              reviving the circus.
            </p>

              I'm available to build your website, take your photo, and more.
